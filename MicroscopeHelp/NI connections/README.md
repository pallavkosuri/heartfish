### NI DAQ control
The different components of the microscope need to comunicate with one-another very fast.
Connecting the different components through the National Instruments Data Aquisition card ensures appropriate synchronization at high frame rate.
On the current system the PCIe-6353 DAQ card is installed in the computer.

The card gets connected to two connector blocks.

The connector blocks are linked to the components via BNC cables or directly.

With a Lumencore system, the cheaper PCIe-6321 is sufficient with only one conector block.
