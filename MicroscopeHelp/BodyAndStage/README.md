### The microscope body and stage

The microscope is build around the Nikon TI-U body.
The main non-standard option is the double turret system:
* the bottom turret for the fluorescent ilumination
* the top turret for the focus-lock system

The bottom turret has a pentaband cube from Chroma allowing for the following excitation wavelengths:
405nm, 488nm, 561nm, 647nm, 750nm.

The top turret has a short-pass dichroic allowing IR of wavelength ~980nm to be imaged on the cover-glass.

We recomend two objectives: 10X-air and 60x-oil as detailed in the components file.

The stage is a Ludl stage equiped with a Z-piezo common for all objectives.
The stage on the current system is controlled via a second usb small NI DAQ card.

In the future the stage Z-piezo will be connected to the AO of the master NI DAQ card.
