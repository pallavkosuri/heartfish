### Focus lock system

In order to control the z-position we use an imaging system on the top turret of the microscope.
Two sligtly angled IR beams are scatter off the water-glass interface.
The distance between these IR beams is measured by a separate inexpensive CCD camera and converted into z-information.

The two beams are generated from a single 980nm laser diode.
They are imaged on a Thorlabs camera which has a filter to prevent other light from accesing it and a focusing lens.

The IR laser has its own controler.
