Generally you want a separation of about ~150-300 pixels horizontal and vertically aligned on the throlabs camera.


The reason for small distance is that HAL will perform computation on the thorlabs image to continuously adjust the stage z and the computation time should be minimized.


At lease 50 pixel horizontal shift in distance is indicated upon moving the Z-piezo +/- a few micrometers up and down.
