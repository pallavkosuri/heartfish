### The fluidics system

The fluidics system is composed of:
1) multiple computerized valves connected in series ()
2) a peristaltic pump (Hamilton)
3) a fluidics chamber (Bioptechs)

### 1) Valves

Each of the valves has 8 input positions and an output position.

Input position 1-7 connect to a 15mL tube containing dersired liquid.
Input position 8 connects to the output of the next valve.
The output of valve 1 connects to the fluidics chamber.

On the back of the valves: Serial cable (male-to-male) connects the input of one valve to the output of the previous one.
The input of valve 1 connects to Serial-to-USB connector and then to the computer.

### 2) Peristaltic pump
Mount the geen-orange colar tube around one of the channels.
One end of this cable is connected to the chamber and the other to waste.
This wears out within a month; replace periodically.

The pump connects to the computer via: GSIOC module -> SERIAL -> USB
The pump can be mounted under the table to reduce space

### 3) Fluidics chamber
This is ordered from Bioptechs FCS2 System (the no-heating version.)
Bioptechs provides a video on how to mount the sample.
