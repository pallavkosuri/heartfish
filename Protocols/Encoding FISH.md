### The protocol for DNA FISH of the primary probes

Plate cells on round 40-mm, #1.5 coverslips (Bioptechs, 0420-0323-2) at a density of
~500,000 cells per coverslip and were grown at 37oC with 5% CO2 for 2 days. 

1) Fix the plated cells for 10 minutes in 4% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and then wash with PBS three times.
(Cells can be stored for ~1week)

* Start the 90oC waterbath and place the hybridization chamber in the 47oC.

* Place the primary probes in the speed-vac (enough for )
Guidelines: Probes are generally kept at 700ng/uL in ddH2O.
Use 10uL of probe for 50uL hybridization buffer for ~20,000 DNA targetting oligos. (~10 µM total primary probes)

2) Perform two permeabilization steps 
* 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, T8787) in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature 
* 0.1M hydrochloric acid for 5 minutes at room temperature each followed by three PBS washes.

3) Incubate the cells in 0.1 mg/mL RNase A in PBS for 45 min at 37oC.
The endogenous RNA in the cells, which could cross-hybridize with our primary probes, is digested by the RNase.

4) Incubate the cells in 50% formamide i 2x SSC for ~10 minutes.

Make hybe buffer 50-10 (2x SSC, 50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate (Sigma, D8906-50G)).

5) Inverte the coverslip with cells on 50 µl of hybe buffer deposited at the bottom of a petri dish. 
Seal the dish and submerge it in a water bath at ~90oC for 3 minutes. 
6) Incubate at 47oC in a humidified incubator for 16 – 18 hours.

7) Wash the sample for 30 minutes at room temperature with 40% formamide in 2xSSC.

8) Post-fix with 4% formaldehyde in 2xSSC 10 minutes. Wash with 2xSSC.

9) Add orange beads 0.04 um (1:10,000) in 2xSSC. Wash with 2xSSC.

10) Add 2xSSC with DAPI.
