### Probe synthesis protocol
1) **PCR reation** (in qPCR tubes - flat top) (~50uL total) 

15uL ddH2O 
2uL 1:50 library 
6uL  fwd and rev primer 10uM each in water
2.5uL EvaGreen 
25uL Phusion HotStart MasterMix 

Run in qPCR machine for ~22-30 cycles (until it starts saturation) 

*Use my settings on qPCR 
  

2) **PCR Cleanup** 

2.1) Mix 7 volumes (350uL) of **DNA binding buffer** with sample, pipetting vigorously. 

2.2) Transfer to Zymo-Spin Column (**DCC-5**) 

2.3) Centrifuge 1 min at high speed. Discard flow-through. 

2.4) Add 300uL **DNA Wash Buffer**. Centrifuge 1 min at high speed. Discard flow-through. 

2.5) Centrifuge 1 min at high speed. (Dry-run - to get rid of residual EtOH.) 

2.6) Elute in 11uL of ddH2O. 

  

3) **T7 reaction** (22uL) 

10uL NTP buffer mix 

2uL T7pol 

1uL RNAsin Plus 

10uL DNA cleaned from PCR 

Incubate for 16h at 37C in PCR machine upstairs. 

  

4) **RT reaction** (45uL) 

6uL dNTP 

8uL RT buffer 

8uL 100uM commonRT primer 

1.5uL Maxima RT enzyme 

2uL RNAsin Plus 

20uL RNA from T7. (No cleanup necessary) 

Incubate for 1h at 50C in PCR machine upstairs. 

  

5) **Alkaline hydrolysis** (90uL) 

Mix 1:1 0.5M EDTA+1M NaOH 

Add 1 volume(~45uL) of EDTA+NaOH to sample. 

Incubate for 10 min at 95C in PCR machine upstairs. 

  

6) **Test on polyacrylamide gel** 

6.1) Warm 1 L of 1x TBE buffer for 2:30 min in microwave. 

6.2) Turn on water-bath to 60C. Fill water bath with enough water to rise to the same level of buffer in the BioRad tank. 

6.3) Insert 15% gel into gel box and load box into tank. Pre-run gel for 10-15 minutes at 120 V to equilibrate gel temperature. 

6.4) Mix 2uL sample, 2uL ddH2O, 4uL 2x Urea-loading buffer (4C fridge) 

6.4b) Mix 2uL 1:10 ultra low range ladder,  2uL ddH2O, 4uL 2x Urea-loading buffer 

6.5) **Optional** Denature samples in loading buffer (e.g. 2x Urea-loading buffer from BioRad) at 90C for 2-5 min. Return to water-ice bath. 

6.6) Flush extra urea from wells prior to loading. 

6.7) Load sample, run gel for 35-40 minutes at 120 V. 

6.8) Gently extract gel from casing. Incubate in 1x Gel-Green in 1x TBE for 10-30 minutes. 

6.9) Image Gel on Typhoon Imager. 

  

7) **RT Cleanup** 

7.1) Mix 2 volumes (180uL) of **Oligo binding buffer** with sample, pipetting vigorously. Add 500uL (or 8 volumes for smaller sample volume) pure EtOH. 

7.2) Transfer to Zymo-Spin Column (**DCC-25**) 

7.3) Centrifuge 1 min at high speed. Discard flow-through. 

7.4) Add 500uL **DNA Wash Buffer**. Centrifuge 1 min at high speed. Discard flow-through. 

7.5) Centrifuge 1 min at high speed. (Dry-run - to get rid of residual EtOH.) 

7.6) Elute in 50uL ddH2O. 

Nanodrop result. Expect ~500-700ng/uL on successful reactions. 



8) **Vaccum concentrator** 

Use sped-vac to concentrate your sample further â€“ to arround 2000ng/ul
